# DFA for Conjuntions/Adverbs/Adjectives
This repository is a university assignment solution for detecting conjunctions, adverbs, and adjectives with 
Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA).

The list of words for conjunctions, adverbs, and adjectives are defined in the `language` folder.
> Words for conjunctions, adverbs, adjectives are generated by ChatGPT as there are no comprehensive list of words 
> found online. The list of words have been cleaned to remove duplicate words.

The `demo text` folder contain two text files where the DFA will be tested against.

The `dfa.py` file defines the DFA class which have functions to generate the finite states and perform detection 
based on the finite states generated.
